The T3 stack is a web development stack proposed by Theo Browne. It is a popular choice to build large scale web applications simply and quickly, taking care of bussiness logic, database handling, object validation, API schemas, authentication and UI styling.

## The tools in the T3 Stack
The T3 stack makes use of the following technologies:

1. [NextJS](https://create.t3.gg) A React framework supporting server side rendering, file based routing and asset optimization.
1. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) A superset of JavaScript with support for static typing that safely compiles into JavaScript.
1. [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) A next-generation Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Tool wich provides a way to align Typescript code with database structures.
1. [Zod](https://zod.dev/) A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
1. [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library for Typescript, tRPC provides an end-to-end typesafe solution for building APIs.
1. [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) An open-source authentication solution for NextJS applications.
1. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework. It differs from traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap by focusing on utility classes rather than predefined components.
